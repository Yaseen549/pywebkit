# PyWebKit - The simplest Python caller out there!

With PyWebKit, you can modernize websites with python with just one line of code. PyWebKit is super easy to use and handles everything for you. Just specify what website you want to call and what media you want to receive back, and the rest is done for you.

# Overview
The PyWebKit Python caller was written with fast use in mind. It provides the following key features

  - call methods - Every function has its own property.
  - The most common call activities (CSS generator) are already implemented
  - Receive special file types like .css


## Usage

In the following paragraphs, I am going to describe how you can get and use PyWebKit for your own projects.

###  Getting it

To download PyWebKit, either fork this github repo or simply use Pypi via pip.
```sh
$ pip install pywebkit
```

### Using it

PyWebKit was programmed with ease-of-use in mind. First, import "css class maker" from PyWebKit

```Python
from pywebkit import css_class_maker
```

And you are ready to go! At this point, I want to clearly distinct what is css class maker. It is just nothing but to create a css file with classes.

Yep, thats all. Just specify that you need to implement import functions
